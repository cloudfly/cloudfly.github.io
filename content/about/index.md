## Profile

I am from the Northeast of China. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. In the ten years since graduation, I have been successively engaged in back - end research and development in several Internet companies, and also do some front - end development work part - time.

The fields involved are mainly basic back - end services (not business back - end), such as operation and maintenance systems, monitoring and alarm systems, message queues, service discovery, reverse proxies, databases, R & D frameworks, and so on. During the construction of these back - end infrastructure services, some front - end support is needed, and usually one person takes care of all of it.

Deep down, I am still a person who loves to design products. So in my spare time, I have also self - studied some skills related to mobile - end development, UX & UI. I have also led small teams at work and interviewed hundreds of people.

## Skills & Abilities

With over 10 years of full-stack development experience, I'm mainly focused on the back-end in terms of technology. The main development tools I use include Golang, React, Ansible, Mac, etc. I also have 9 years of system construction experience in the field of observability.
